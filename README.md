# DataSpark-Illuminating-Insights-for-Global-Electronics-using-by-Powerbi
This is my second Data Scientist project: As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, you are tasked with conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from the companyâ€™s data. that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth  Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, has provided you with several datasets containing information about their customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates. The company seeks to leverage this data to better understand their business and identify areas for improvement.

Aproach:
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).

Load Data:
Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.

Power BI Visualization:
 Connect SQL to Power BI, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.

Develop 10 SQL Queries:
Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data. These queries should address important business questions and support the analysis.
